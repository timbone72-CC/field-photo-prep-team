# Field Photo Prep Team Change Control Contract

## Purpose

Control how Team changes are planned, implemented, tested, reviewed, merged, and rolled back. The process must match the real risk: strong enough to protect authorization, offline work, and field photos without turning every small improvement into a large project.

## Core rule

No runtime phase begins until `docs/ROADMAP.md` contains an approved implementation plan for that phase. If the plan is incomplete, planning is the work.

No intentional feature work is performed directly on `main`.

## Change levels

### Level 1 — low risk

Typical examples:
- documentation/comments;
- test wording that does not redefine behavior;
- noninteractive copy;
- appearance-only changes with no effect on authorization, persisted state, capture, upload, deletion, or deployment.

Required process:
- isolated branch;
- state changed surface and protected behavior;
- inspect diff;
- run only checks appropriate to that surface.

### Level 2 — normal feature or fix

Typical examples:
- ordinary dashboard/Android screens and controls;
- non-destructive status presentation;
- normal workflow additions that do not alter persisted schemas, authorization, assignment ownership, photo identity, retry identity, or destructive behavior.

Required process:
- isolated branch and PR;
- record exact user-facing problem/behavior;
- identify owning files/functions and read/write surfaces;
- identify protected behavior and rollback point;
- run focused tests during development;
- run the complete automated suite once on the exact final runtime head;
- run only affected smoke/device checks.

The user's approved request authorizes the documented Level 1/2 scope. Do not ask again unless scope changes.

### Level 3 — high risk

Typical examples:
- Supabase DDL/migrations;
- RLS/Auth/role/organization authorization changes;
- Room/local persisted schema changes or migrations;
- offline write queue/conflict/reassignment/cancellation semantics;
- photo identity/protected-original/prepared-copy changes;
- background sync/retry authority;
- remote upload/destination/reconciliation/cleanup;
- destructive actions;
- signing, production deployment, or test/production boundary changes.

Required process:
- dedicated branch and PR;
- roadmap-approved behavior plus a detailed implementation/impact record when the roadmap is not specific enough for the exact change;
- exact rollback steps before implementation;
- realistic safe fixtures/test environment;
- focused tests and final complete automated verification;
- affected data-preservation/security/device/provider checks;
- Supabase advisors after DDL;
- explicit operator approval before merge.

When uncertain between levels, use the higher level.

## Scope and ownership

Change the smallest module that owns the behavior. Adjacent defects are reported separately unless the user expands scope.

Protected ownership boundaries:
- Supabase/Auth/RLS: server identity and authorization;
- local persistence: durable offline device state;
- sync/reconciliation: pending actions and server convergence;
- camera: capture/lifecycle;
- photo storage/preparation: protected originals and derivatives;
- remote storage: exact remote destination/identity/outcome;
- UI: requests actions and renders state.

A helper or UI component may not silently take ownership from another boundary.

## Team/V1 separation

Team changes may inspect FPP as a reference but may not modify the V1 repository, V1 app identity, V1 storage, or V1 field data.

## Diff control

Before merge:
- inspect every changed file;
- explain every changed block for Level 2/3 work;
- remove unrelated changes;
- verify no secrets/customer data entered the public repository;
- verify the final diff still matches the approved roadmap behavior.

## Supabase/database rules

For database changes:
- DDL goes through migrations;
- every applied migration is mirrored under `supabase/migrations/`;
- migration order/live history and repository history must agree;
- RLS/grants/RPC execution permissions are explicitly tested;
- advisors are run after DDL;
- client code never receives service-role/secret credentials.

## Offline/conflict rules

Any change that can create local/server divergence must document:
- which fact is authoritative locally and remotely;
- what happens offline;
- restart recovery;
- retry/idempotency behavior;
- reassignment/cancellation races;
- conflict resolution or fail-closed behavior;
- what user-visible state appears while unresolved.

Do not resolve conflicts by silently dropping started work.

## Photo/upload rules

Any change touching photos or upload must document:
- permanent local photo identity;
- immutable WO binding;
- protected-original behavior;
- prepared derivative behavior;
- queue state transitions;
- remote identity/destination;
- uncertain outcome handling;
- duplicate prevention;
- cleanup eligibility;
- restart recovery.

A failed/ambiguous upload must never be reported as confirmed success.

## Verification matrix

Documentation-only:
- mandatory-read/diff review only.

Level 1 runtime:
- focused check if applicable;
- affected-surface smoke check.

Level 2:
- focused regression coverage;
- one final complete automated suite;
- affected workflow/device smoke check only.

Level 3:
- focused + complete regression coverage;
- safe fixtures/provider validation where applicable;
- authorization/data-preservation checks;
- affected real-device gate where software cannot prove reality;
- explicit pre-merge operator approval.

A required failure stops merge/publication/deployment.

## Rollback

Identify the prior known-good commit before merging runtime work. Prefer reverting the narrow change over stacking guesses onto a broken branch.

Rollback must not intentionally delete unconfirmed local work, queued photos, protected originals, or remote identity evidence needed to prevent duplicates.

## Maintenance rule

Working behavior is not rewritten merely because a cleaner abstraction exists. Add architecture only when the Team workflow demonstrates a need.
